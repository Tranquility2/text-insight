# text-insight

* Upload API is limited to 200MB
* TODO: Document assumption regarding txt files + utf-8
* TODO: Document assumption that files name is available in the url
* Would be cool to add support for txt files that are compressed in zip
* Right now api request get responded immediately, it will be a nice improvement to add a ticketing system,
  this way we can track the process using another API
